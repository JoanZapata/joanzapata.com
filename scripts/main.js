There was a lot to do so I focused myself on five main aspects.<ul><li><b>Continuous integration</b> using <a href='https://jenkins.io/' target='_blank'>Jenkins</a> and <a href='https://fastlane.tools/' target='_blank'>Fastlane</a><li><b>Continuous delivery</b> to <a href='http://try.crashlytics.com/beta/' target='_blank'>Beta</a> and the AppStore</li><li><b>AppStore screenshots generation</b> using UI tests and <a href='https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot' target='_blank'>Snapshot</a></li><li><b>Refactoring</b> out of a singleton based architecture</li><li><b>Tests</b> of all business rules in a separate framework with no dependency</li></ul>I learned a lot during this experience. Enabling in-app vehicle condition was a UX challenge, and the BLE communication library was a really good case for TDD/BDD. Eliminating the many obstacles in the beta/release process was really fulfilling. Working with legacy code, although frustrating at first, sharpened my skills at separating concerns, and taught me once again the importance of tests."},{name:"Memori",side:!0,icon:"images/memori.png",date:"2016",skills:["Design","iOS"],screenshots:["memori_walkthrough1.jpg","memori_walkthrough2.jpg","memori_walkthrough3.jpg","memori_walkthrough4.jpg"],description:"Memori helps people stop forgetting what matters to them using gamification.
